# Image Video Gallery
Android application to display image and video from Gallery using Kotlin Programming Language.

# Runtime Permission Required to Display Image and Video
Android's permission system is one of the biggest security concern all along since those permissions are asked for at install time. Once installed, the application will be able to access all of things granted without any user's acknowledgement what exactly application does with the permission.

In Android 6.0 Marshmallow, application will not be granted any permission at installation time. Instead, application has to ask user for a permission one-by-one at runtime.
